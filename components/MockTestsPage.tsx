Assuming the statements to be true, even if they seem to be at variance with commonly known facts, decide which of the conclusions logically follows from the statements. \nStatements: All pages are diaries. Some diaries are books. All books are notebooks.\nConclusions: I. No page is a notebook. II. All pages are notebooks. III. All diaries being notebooks is a possibility.", optionA: "Both conclusion I and II follow", optionB: "Only conclusions I and III follow", optionC: "Only conclusion III follows", optionD: "Only conclusion II follows", correctAnswer: "C", explanation: "Based on the statements, we can draw a Venn diagram. 'Pages' circle is inside 'diaries'. 'Diaries' circle overlaps with 'books'. 'Books' circle is inside 'notebooks'.\nConclusion I: 'No page is a notebook' is not definitely true, as there's no direct negative relation.\nConclusion II: 'All pages are notebooks' is not definitely true.\nConclusion III: 'All diaries being notebooks is a possibility' is true. It's possible for the 'diaries' circle to be completely inside the 'notebooks' circle without violating any statement.", subject: "Reasoning" },

Therefore, only one letter's position is unchanged.", subject: "Reasoning" },
    { questionId: 3, examId: "SSC-REASONING-01", questionText: "In a certain code language, ‘A + B’ means ‘A is the mother of B’; ‘A − B’ means ‘A is the brother of B’; ‘A × B’ means ‘A is the wife of B’ and ‘A ÷ B’ means ‘A is the father of B’. Based on the above, how is 4 related to 2 if ‘4 + 3 ÷ 2 ÷ 1 − 5’?", optionA: "Father's father", optionB: "Father's mother", optionC: "Mother's father", optionD: "Mother's mother", correctAnswer: "D", explanation: "Let's decode the expression '4 + 3 ÷ 2':\n1. '4 + 3' means '4 is the mother of 3'.\n2. '3 ÷ 2' means '3 is the father of 2'.\nCombining these, 4 is the mother of 3, and 3 is the father of 2. This makes 4 the mother of 2's father, which is the paternal grandmother (Father's mother).

To which of the following is ‘BANG’ related, following the same logic?", optionA: "ZYLU", optionB: "ZYNS", optionC: "YZNU", optionD: "YZMT", correctAnswer: "C", explanation: "The logic is based on opposite letter pairs (A=Z, B=Y, etc.).\n- W's opposite is D.\n- I's opposite is R.\n- S's opposite is H.\n- K's opposite is P.\nSo, WISK → DRHP. Similarly, LENT → OVMG.\nFor BANG:\n- B's opposite is Y.\n- A's opposite is Z.\n- N's opposite is M.\n- G's opposite is T.\nThe correct answer should be YZMT.
